TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.670
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.510
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.350
Actions on Google is coming to
new devices and new languages,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.500
and getting better for building
and sharing apps with templates

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.730
and transactions.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.360
Check out all the
details and links

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.620
on the post linked in
the description below.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.890
Also, the Google Assistant is
now available on Android TV

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
and, although there
are no new APIs needed

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.720
to integrate with it, you
should follow the pattern

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.800
that it expects from your app.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.870
This post has all the
details, including code.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.820
We recently launched Cloud
Firestore, a fully-managed,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.450
no SQL, document database for
mobile and web app development.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.760
It's designed to easily
store and sync app

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.359
data at global scale, and
it's now available in beta.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.400
Take a look at the post
for an introduction video

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
and highlights.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.540
Chef is a continuous
automation platform powered

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.610
by an awesome community.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150
We recently released
and open sourced

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.220
a set of comprehensive
cookbooks for Chef users

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.160
to manage Google Cloud
Platform resources.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.319
Together, Chef and
Google Cloud Platform

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.270
enable you to drive
continuous automation

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.600
across infrastructure,
compliance, and applications.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.490
PHP 7.1 is now generally
available on Google App Engine

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.350
in the flexible environment.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.260
Check out the post for how to
deploy PHP applications on App

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.120

extension enabler, stack

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.170
drive for logging, and more.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.320
Google Compute Engine now
supports nested virtualization

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.310
in beta.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.550
This allows you to run one
or more virtual machines

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.040
inside a compute engine
Linux virtual machine,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.300
VMs inside of VMs.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.550
Java 8 on App Engine
standard environment

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.990

Abseil is an open
source collection

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.610
of C Plus Plus library code
designed to augment the C Plus

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.230
Plus standard library.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.180
These libraries are
the nuts and bolts

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.520
that underpin almost
everything that Google

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.540
runs and have been extensively
tested and used in production.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.160
